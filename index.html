		<h4>History of Antigua</h4>
		<p> 16th-century Renaissance grid pattern and Baroque-style monumental buildings and ruins have survived along with cobblestone streets, plazas with fountains, and domestic architecture. Antigua Guatemala has retained the integrity of its 16th-century layout and the physical integrity of most of its built heritage. The relocation transfer of the capital after the 1773 earthquake and the abandonment of the area by most of its population permitted the preservation of many of its monumental Baroque-style buildings as ruins. </p>

The woven textiles in particular are a famous regional creation, and although souvenirs like these can be found all over town, wandering through the tourist market to the west of the main square will be quite a colorful experience.

				<h5> Hotel Camino Real </h5>
				<p> "Excellent facilities and atmosphere, good food and a totally clean place. The service in the restaurant could improve from good to excellent. In short, I think it is one of the most luxurious hotels that Antigua Guatemala can offer."

			<h5>Porta Hotel</h5>
			<p> "Porta Hotel Antigua was a lovely hotel in the heart of the city but nestled away in a more quiet location. It was easy to walk every where we wanted and there was much to go see, do, but most importantly, eat and drink. 
The hotel itself is comprised of three locations all side by side. One of them even has a tunnel going under the road to get there. The main pool is huge with bar service and the breakfast buffet was pretty good. 
The room though was fabulous. The beds comfortable, the bathroom was large and plenty of natural light."

				<h5> San Rafael Hotel </h5>
				<p> "Love this place! Near by all restaurant and shopping street. The location is the heart of Antigua. Nice and elegant boutique hotel, and very safe and quiet. All staff were helpful and friendly. Price of drink and food ( we ordered 2 plates of fruit and martini/ wine ) was very reasonable, which is really nice. Breakfast is awesome- Ordered bagel / Chapin (egg) and Continental (croissant ) This hotel will be our “HOTEL” in Antigua. Definitely go back!"

				<h5> Hotel Sor Juana </h5>
				<p> "I have to say that my wife and I spend a great Romantic weekend in Antigua. We stay at Hotel Sor Juan. This five room boutique hotel is great. Very beautiful and clean. The personal of the hotel are excellent. Very educated, kind and servicial. The front desk girl call "Frida" is wonderful. She is going to see that you spend a nice time in the hotel. I recommend this hotel for couples. Not to go with kids."
